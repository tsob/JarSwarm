JarSwarm
========

This is a version of EighthPlague (interactive swarm simulation sonification) for use with a jar containing an accelerometer, a BeagleBoard-xM, an Arduino, and other goodies. It was developed at CCRMA (Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics) in the fall of 2012 as part of the Physical Interaction Design course.

Please see JarSwarmPaper.pdf for detailed project information. This is an archived repo. The original repo is at https://github.com/iliaskarim/EighthPlague, which is itself a fork of https://github.com/tsob/EighthPlague.
